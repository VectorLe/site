		<h2>Recommended Beginner Program and Tips</h2>

			<p>
				Watch some vids on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHenEUQGBRGPLduDE-khmSCeNHYNPOkDe" target="_blank">here</a> to learn how to do the basic movements.
			</p>
			<li>
				<u><strong>Starting weights:</strong></u> Start with something that's moderately difficult but you could do comfortably for about 6-7 reps. This won't matter much as you progress, since you'll be increasing weight anyway.
			</li>
			<li>
				<u><strong>How to do the program:</strong></u> As you can see below, the program allows for rep <strong>RANGES</strong>. This means that you will be correctly following the program so long as your sets fall within the range of reps. Within the rep range, aim for sets such that you leave <strong>ONE MORE</strong> rep in the tank. This means that you should confidently be able to do at least 1 more rep at the end of each set. Just follow the table below and adhere to the progression protocol in the following bullet point. As for Conditioning days, you are free to do whatever exercises you like. Please, keep track of what weights/reps you're doing for each workout so you know what to do for the next workout.
			</li>
			<li>
				<u><strong>Progression:</strong></u> If you hit 4 reps, repeat the same weight next time. If you hit 5 reps, you can <strong>CHOOSE</strong> whether you want to repeat the same weight and aim for 6 reps, or if you want to add 5lbs. If you hit 6 reps, add 5lbs.
			</li>
            <li>
                <u><strong>What to do on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays?</strong></u> Check out <a href="https://www.exrx.net/Lists/Directory" target="_blank">ExRx</a> for some ideas. 
            </li>
			<li>
				<u><strong>Why no variety?</strong></u> Beginners need to build their foundation. You also have Tuesdays,Thursdays, and Saturdays to do whatever you like. Run this until you plateau (stop progressing in both reps and weights) and get the basics down.
			</li>
			<li>
				<u><strong>Why use this program?</strong></u> A lot of cookie-cutter programs tell you to just "do a set of 5" for example. What if you can't? This program gives you some wiggle room so you can capitalize on your good days and allow for some room to do less than normal on bad days.
